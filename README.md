NTupliser for Brunel group

The famous nTupliser passed down from one generation of Brunel phD student to the next. 
All our marks left indelibly on it, if no other reason than that the next guy has no idea what we did.
Needs documentation, cleaning and... I dunno, re-writing?

Stuff that I know needs to be fixed before run2:

-getByLabels need to be changed to consumes

Enjoy, future students.

CMSSW_7_4_0 branch contains code from CMSSW_5_3_X branch which is being modified to work for Run 2 data.
As data taking is using CMSSW_7_4_X, the branch is named CMSSW_7_4_0 until the earliest release for Run 2 data which this can be run on is established.
Development is currently being undertaken in CMSSW_7_4_7.

To be continued ...

Alexander.
